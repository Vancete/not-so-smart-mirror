# Not so Smart Mirror

![Not so Smart Mirror image](https://i.imgur.com/LTpay7j.jpg)

A project made to be a useful dashboard and cool to show it at home

Made with React under ionic and running on Android with Capacitor

## Config

The code is not perfectly organised but well enough to be easily configured just by going to App.jsx and put there your apiKeys and settings for the different widgets (Weather, Twitter Trends, etc)

## Running

Install all the node dependencies

    npm install

Build your React app

    npm run build

Sync the build with Capacitor

    npm cap sync

Run it on Android

    npm cap run android
